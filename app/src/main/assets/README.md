## Audio Files

### click.wav
This directory should contain a `click.wav` file for the metronome beat sound.

**Specifications:**
- Format: WAV
- Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Channels: Mono
- Duration: ~50ms (short click sound)
- Volume: Normalized to prevent clipping

**How to add the click.wav file:**
1. Record or download a short click/tick sound
2. Convert to WAV format with the specifications above
3. Place the file in this directory as `click.wav`

**Alternative:**
You can use any short audio file (mp3, wav, etc.) and rename it to `click.wav`. The MediaPlayer will handle most common audio formats.

**For testing purposes:**
If you don't have a click sound file, you can temporarily use any short audio file renamed to `click.wav` to test the functionality.
